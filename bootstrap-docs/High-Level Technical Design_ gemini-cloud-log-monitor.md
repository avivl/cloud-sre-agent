### **3.1. Architectural Principles**

* **Agent-Based & Modular:** The system will be designed as a collection of specialized agents (or microservices), each responsible for a specific part of the workflow. This promotes separation of concerns and scalability.  
* **Event-Driven:** The workflow will be triggered by events, such as new log entries matching a certain pattern, ensuring a responsive and efficient system.  
* **Stateless Components:** Individual agent components will be designed to be stateless, receiving all necessary context for a given task and simplifying deployment and scaling.  
* **Observability:** The system will be designed with comprehensive logging and tracing to monitor its own operations and decision-making processes.

### **3.3. Component Breakdown**

* **Log Ingestion:**  
  * **Technology:** Google Cloud Logging Sink, Pub/Sub.  
  * **Flow:** A GCP Logging Sink is configured to export logs matching a filter (e.g., severity\>=ERROR) to a Pub/Sub topic. This decouples the agent from the logging service.  
* **Orchestrator:**  
  * **Technology:** Google Cloud Functions.  
  * **Responsibility:** A central, event-triggered function that manages the workflow. It listens to Pub/Sub topics and invokes the appropriate agent (Triage or Analysis) via an HTTP request.  
* **Triage Agent:**  
  * **Technology:** Cloud Run service (Python/Flask), Vertex AI API.\[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\]  
  * **Logic:**  
    1. Receives a batch of log entries from the Orchestrator.  
    2. Constructs a prompt for the gemini-1.5-flash model to perform a quick classification: "Is this log pattern indicative of a critical, user-impacting issue? Respond with JSON: {is\_critical: boolean, summary: string}".\[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 17\]  
    3. If is\_critical is true, it publishes the incident details to the critical-incident Pub/Sub topic.  
* **Analysis Agent:**  
  * **Technology:** Cloud Run service (Python/Flask), Vertex AI API.  
  * **Logic:**  
    1. Receives a critical incident context from the Orchestrator.  
    2. Gathers extended context: pulls the last 1 hour of logs for the affected service, fetches the service's Terraform configuration from the Git repo, and retrieves the relevant runbook from a documentation folder.  
    3. Constructs a comprehensive prompt for the gemini-1.5-pro model, leveraging its large context window.\[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23\]  
    4. Uses the Gemini API's **Code Execution** tool to calculate precise error rates or other metrics to validate its findings.\[1\]  
    5. Passes the final, detailed analysis to the Remediation Agent.  
* **Remediation Agent:**  
  * **Technology:** Cloud Run service (Python/Flask), GitHub API.  
  * **Logic:**  
    1. Receives the structured analysis from the Analysis Agent.  
    2. Uses the GitHub API to: create a new branch, apply the code/config changes suggested by the Analysis Agent, and open a pull request with a body populated from the analysis.

### **3.4. Technology Stack**

* **Cloud Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  
* **Compute:** Cloud Run, Cloud Functions  
* **Messaging:** Pub/Sub  
* **AI/ML:** Vertex AI Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro) \[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\]  
* **Language:** Python 3.11+  
* **Source Control & CI/CD:** GitHub, GitHub Actions

### **3.5. CI/CD and Deployment**

The entire agent infrastructure will be managed as code (Terraform) and deployed via GitHub Actions. The run-gemini-cli GitHub Action will be used for:

* **Automated Code Reviews:** On every PR for the agent's own codebase, Gemini will provide a review.  
* **Deployment Workflows:** A GitHub Actions workflow will run terraform apply to deploy the Cloud Functions and Cloud Run services.  
* **Agent Execution (Alternative Model):** For periodic checks (as opposed to real-time), the entire agent logic could be packaged into a script and run on a schedule using the run-gemini-cli action within a GitHub-hosted runner.
