# **Product Requirements Document (PRD): gemini-cloud-log-monitor**

### **2.1. Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for the gemini-cloud-log-monitor, an AI agent that automates the detection of and response to issues in Google Cloud services. The primary goal is to reduce the manual toil on SRE and DevOps teams, decrease the time it takes to identify and fix production issues, and proactively improve system stability.

### **2.2. Business Objectives & Success Metrics**

| Business Objective | Success Metrics |
| :---- | :---- |
| Reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) | 40% reduction in MTTR for P1/P2 incidents within 6 months. |
| Decrease Manual SRE Toil | 60% reduction in time spent by SREs manually analyzing logs for incident diagnosis. |
| Improve System Reliability | 25% decrease in recurring incidents of the same type due to proactive fixes. |
| Accelerate Developer Onboarding | New engineers can understand the root cause of common production issues 50% faster by reviewing the agent's detailed PRs. |

### **2.3. Target Audience**

* **Primary Users:** Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), DevOps Engineers, On-Call Engineers.  
* **Secondary Users:** Software Developers, Engineering Managers, Security Operations (SecOps) Teams.

### **2.4. Features & User Stories**

This section details the core features prioritized into "Must-Have" and "Nice-to-Have" categories.

**Must-Have (MVP):**

* **Automated Log Analysis:**  
  * **As an SRE,** I want the agent to monitor logs from configured GCP services (App Engine, Cloud Run, GKE) in near real-time, **so that** I am immediately aware of potential issues.  
* **Intelligent Error Detection:**  
  * **As a DevOps Engineer,** I want the agent to distinguish between transient warnings and critical error patterns, **so that** I can focus on high-priority problems and reduce alert fatigue.  
* **Automated Pull Request Generation:**  
  * **As an On-Call Engineer,** I want the agent to automatically create a detailed GitHub pull request when a critical issue is found, **so that** I have a comprehensive summary, root cause analysis, and a proposed fix ready for review.  
* **Multi-Model AI Core:**  
  * **As an Engineering Manager,** I want the system to use a cost-effective model (Gemini Flash) for initial triage and a powerful model (Gemini Pro) for deep analysis, **so that** we can achieve high accuracy without incurring excessive operational costs.\[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\]  
* **Configurable Service Monitoring:**  
  * **As a DevOps Engineer,** I want to be able to configure which services, log levels, and projects the agent monitors via a simple YAML file, **so that** I can easily adapt the agent to our evolving infrastructure.

**Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP):**

* **Advanced Alerting Integration:**  
  * **As an SRE,** I want the agent to send configurable, severity-based alerts to PagerDuty and Slack, **so that** our on-call rotation is immediately notified of critical incidents.  
* **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Fixes:**  
  * **As a DevOps Engineer,** I want the agent to be able to suggest fixes for misconfigurations by generating changes to our Terraform files, **so that** we can remediate infrastructure issues as quickly as code issues.  
* **Extensible Tooling via MCP:**  
  * **As a Senior SRE,** I want the ability to extend the agent with custom tools (via MCP), **so that** the agent can enrich its analysis with business-specific context.

### **2.5. Assumptions**

* The organization uses Google Cloud Platform for hosting services.  
* The organization uses GitHub for source code management.  
* A "human-in-the-loop" approach is desired; the agent will propose fixes via PRs but not merge them automatically.

### **2.6. Out of Scope for v1.0**

* Real-time dashboarding and visualization.  
* Support for cloud providers other than GCP.  
* Predictive analysis to forecast future incidents.
