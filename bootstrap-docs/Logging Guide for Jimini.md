# Logging Guide for Jimini

This document provides a complete overview of logging practices, concepts, and implementation in the Jimini ecosystem. It serves as both a theoretical foundation and practical implementation guide for effective logging across our applications.

## Core Logging Concepts (Language Agnostic)

### Logging Philosophy

Our logging approach is built on four fundamental principles:

#### Structured Logging

- **Concept**: Logs should be machine-readable with consistent, structured data formats  
- **Benefits**: Enables automated parsing, querying, and analysis by log management systems  
- **Implementation**: Use JSON format in production environments for systematic log processing

#### Contextual Information

- **Concept**: Logs should include relevant metadata that helps trace and understand operations  
- **Key Context Elements**:  
  - Request identifiers for tracking individual operations  
  - Trace identifiers for distributed system correlation  
  - User/entity identifiers for operation attribution  
  - Temporal context (timestamps, durations)  
- **Benefits**: Enables comprehensive debugging and system monitoring

#### Appropriate Log Levels

- **Concept**: Categorize log messages by severity and importance  
- **Standard Levels** (from most to least severe):  
  - `FATAL`: Application-terminating errors  
  - `ERROR`: Runtime errors preventing operation completion  
  - `WARN`: Potentially harmful situations or unusual occurrences  
  - `INFO`: Important lifecycle events and successful operations  
  - `DEBUG`: Detailed diagnostic information for development  
  - `TRACE`: Most granular detail for deep debugging

#### Performance Consciousness

- **Concept**: Logging should have minimal impact on application performance  
- **Considerations**:  
  - Use high-performance logging libraries  
  - Avoid logging in performance-critical hot paths  
  - Balance information richness with performance overhead

### Environment-Specific Logging Strategies

#### Production Environment

- **Format**: Structured JSON for machine processing  
- **Default Level**: INFO (focusing on operational events)  
- **Integration**: Optimized for log aggregation systems  
- **Security**: Strict PII (Personally Identifiable Information) protection

#### Development Environment

- **Format**: Human-readable, pretty-printed output  
- **Default Level**: DEBUG (detailed diagnostic information)  
- **Integration**: Console-friendly for immediate feedback  
- **Flexibility**: More permissive for debugging purposes

### Contextual Logging Patterns

#### Request-Scoped Logging

- **Concept**: Associate logs with specific user requests or operations  
- **Implementation**: Use request identifiers to correlate related log entries  
- **Benefits**: Enables end-to-end request tracing

#### Distributed Tracing Integration

- **Concept**: Connect logs across multiple services and systems  
- **Implementation**: Use trace identifiers that span service boundaries  
- **Benefits**: Enables complex system debugging and performance analysis

#### Hierarchical Context

- **Concept**: Create parent-child relationships between loggers  
- **Implementation**: Child loggers inherit parent context while adding specific details  
- **Benefits**: Maintains context consistency while providing granular information

### Log Level Usage Guidelines

#### FATAL (Critical System Failures)

- **When**: Unrecoverable errors causing application termination  
- **Examples**: Database connection failures at startup, critical configuration errors  
- **Frequency**: Extremely rare

#### ERROR (Operation Failures)

- **When**: Runtime errors preventing specific operations from completing  
- **Examples**: API request failures, unhandled exceptions, resource access errors  
- **Frequency**: Should be monitored and investigated

#### WARN (Potential Issues)

- **When**: Unusual situations that don't prevent operation completion  
- **Examples**: API rate limits approaching, deprecated feature usage, gracefully handled errors  
- **Frequency**: Regular monitoring, may indicate developing issues

#### INFO (Operational Events)

- **When**: Important lifecycle events and successful significant operations  
- **Examples**: Server startup, user authentication, successful API responses  
- **Frequency**: Should provide clear operational narrative

#### DEBUG (Development Diagnostics)

- **When**: Detailed information useful for development and troubleshooting  
- **Examples**: Request parameters, intermediate calculations, detailed operation steps  
- **Frequency**: Typically disabled in production

#### TRACE (Granular Details)

- **When**: Most detailed level for deep debugging of specific components  
- **Examples**: Function call traces, detailed state information  
- **Frequency**: Usually enabled only for specific debugging sessions
