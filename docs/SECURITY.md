# Security Guide

This guide outlines security best practices and considerations for deploying and operating the Cloud SRE Agent in a production environment. Ensuring the security of your agent and its interactions with cloud platforms and GitHub is paramount.

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

### Cloud Platform Authentication

*   **Service Accounts:** Always use dedicated cloud platform service accounts for deploying and running the Cloud SRE Agent in production. Avoid using user credentials.
*   **Least Privilege:** Grant the service account only the minimum necessary IAM roles and permissions. Refer to the [Cloud Platform Setup Guide](CLOUD_SETUP.md) for recommended roles.
*   **Workload Identity (Kubernetes):** If deploying to Kubernetes, leverage Workload Identity to securely bind Kubernetes Service Accounts to cloud platform service accounts, eliminating the need to manage service account keys.
*   **Application Default Credentials (ADC):** The agent uses ADC to authenticate with cloud platform services. Ensure the environment where the agent runs has access to valid ADC (e.g., via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable pointing to a service account key file, or by running on a cloud platform compute resource with an attached service account).

### GitHub Authentication

*   **Personal Access Tokens (PATs):** For the `RemediationAgent` to interact with GitHub, a Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate scopes (`repo` scope for full repository control) is required.
*   **Fine-Grained PATs:** Prefer using fine-grained PATs with the most restrictive permissions possible, limiting access to specific repositories and actions.
*   **GitHub Apps:** For more robust and scalable integration, consider developing a GitHub App. GitHub Apps offer more granular permissions, better security, and are designed for long-lived integrations.

## 2. Secret Management

Sensitive credentials like GitHub PATs should never be hardcoded or stored directly in version control. Use a secure secret management solution.

*   **Cloud Platform Secret Management:** Recommended for managing secrets in your chosen cloud platform. Store your GitHub PAT and any other sensitive configuration values in the platform's secret management service (e.g., Google Secret Manager, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Refer to the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md) for examples on integrating secret management with cloud services.
*   **Environment Variables:** While convenient for development, avoid using plain environment variables for secrets in production. If absolutely necessary, ensure they are managed securely by your deployment platform.

## 3. Data Protection and Encryption

### Data in Transit

*   **TLS/SSL:** All communication with cloud platform APIs (AI services, messaging services, logging) and GitHub API is encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL.

### Data at Rest

*   **Cloud Logging:** Logs stored in cloud logging services are encrypted at rest by default.
*   **Messaging Services:** Messages in messaging services are encrypted at rest by default.

## 4. Compliance Considerations

(This section would discuss any relevant compliance standards or regulations that the agent's operation might need to adhere to, e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2. This is a placeholder for future expansion.)

## 5. Threat Model and Mitigations

(This section would outline potential threats to the agent and its operation, and corresponding mitigation strategies. This is a placeholder for future expansion.)

### Example Threats:

*   **Malicious Log Injection:** An attacker injects malicious log entries to trigger unintended remediation actions.
    *   **Mitigation:** Robust input validation in `TriageAgent`, human review of PRs, strict IAM permissions for the agent.
*   **Compromised GitHub Token:** An attacker gains access to the agent's GitHub PAT.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use Secret Manager, fine-grained PATs, regularly rotate tokens, monitor GitHub audit logs.
*   **Model Bias/Hallucination:** AI models generate incorrect or harmful remediation plans.
    *   **Mitigation:** Human review of PRs, continuous monitoring of model output, robust testing, prompt engineering best practices.

## 6. Security Best Practices

*   **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit IAM policies, service account permissions, and GitHub PATs.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Ensure comprehensive logging and monitoring of the agent's activities to detect suspicious behavior.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Regularly scan the agent's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Security:** Implement network security controls (e.g., VPC Service Controls, VPC Access Connector for cloud services) to restrict network access.
