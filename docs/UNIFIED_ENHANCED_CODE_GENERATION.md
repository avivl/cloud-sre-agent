## Usage Examples

### Basic Code Generation

```python
from gemini_sre_agent.ml.unified_workflow_orchestrator import UnifiedWorkflowOrchestrator

# Initialize the orchestrator
orchestrator = UnifiedWorkflowOrchestrator()

# Execute workflow for an issue
result = await orchestrator.execute_workflow(
    issue_context={
        "type": "API_ERROR",
        "description": "Authentication failure in user service",
        "severity": "HIGH"
    },
    repository_context={
        "path": "/path/to/repo",
        "recent_commits": [...],
        "dependencies": [...]
    }
)

# Get generated code and validation results
generated_code = result.generated_code
validation_result = result.validation_result
```

### Specialized Code Generation

```python
from gemini_sre_agent.ml.code_generator_factory import CodeGeneratorFactory

# Get specialized generator
factory = CodeGeneratorFactory()
generator = factory.get_generator("API_ERROR")

# Generate code for specific issue
code = await generator.generate_code(
    issue_context=issue_context,
    repository_context=repository_context
)
```

### Validation and Quality Assurance

```python
from gemini_sre_agent.ml.validation import CodeValidationPipeline

# Initialize validation pipeline
pipeline = CodeValidationPipeline()

# Validate generated code
result = await pipeline.validate_code(
    code=generated_code,
    context=validation_context
)

# Check validation results
if result.is_valid:
    print("Code passed all validation checks")
else:
    for issue in result.issues:
        print(f"Validation issue: {issue.message}")
```
